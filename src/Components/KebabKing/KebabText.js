            After I was discharged from the military I had some ideas for mobile games that I wanted to make. 
            I used a platform called GameSalad which is a visual editor (drag and drop) that provides the outer 
            shell of development and is based on behavior and logic, events and object oriented.
            <br/> <br/>
            I publisged a few games to Apple and Android stores and really enjoyed the whole process of creation, 
            the process of a raw idea I had in mind slowly becomes a real thing, and also changes along the way, 
            eventually becoming a product that people enjoy.
            <br/><br/>
            My favorite game was a game called 'The Kebab King' - an arcade game where you have to serve impatient customers at a kebab stand, similar to an old and nostalgic game called 
            "Falafel King". <br/><br/>The game reached the top 10 of the games in Israel in the Android Play store for a while and had over 50,000 downloads there.</p>
